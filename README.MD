An experiment to build instagram, not intended to be fully feature but more a sandbox to use what I learned at work.

## Development

``` bash
# spin up data stores
docker-compose up -d

# start api
cd api
npm run start:dev

# start client
cd ../client
npm run dev
```

navigate to http://localhost:3000
